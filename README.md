## Usage

To run the Jest unit tests, run npm test in your terminal. This will execute all of the tests in the __tests__ directory.

## Writing Tests

If you want to write your own Jest unit tests for [Your App Name], you can do so by creating a new file in the __tests__ directory with the .test.js extension. Jest will automatically pick up and run any files with this extension.

### Here's an example test file:

```
const myFunction = require('./myFunction');

  test('it should return true', () => {
    expect(myFunction()).toBe(true);
  });

```

This test checks that myFunction returns true. You can write your own tests in a similar fashion.
